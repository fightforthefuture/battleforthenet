Battle for the Net!
-------------------

* **This is the source code for [battleforthenet.com][1]!**

Don't let the FCC kill net neutrality! The Battle for the Net is a
collaboration between [Fight for the Future][4], [Demand Progress][5] and a
coalition of people and companies who care about keeping the Internet free.
If you have a web site, you can get involved by embedding our FCC Contact
Form. Or, if you have technical skills and time to volunteer, you can help us
win one of the biggest fights for Internet freedom EVER!


### Embed our FCC Contact Form

We've created a form that lets people directly contact the FCC to comment on
their ["14-28 Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet"][2] proposal,
which could actually _destroy_ the Internet by allowing ISPs to extort money
from web sites and startups.

If you want to embed our contact form, use the following code: (See it in
action at **[netneutrality.com][6]!**)

    <iframe src="https://www.battleforthenet.com/embed.html"
        frameborder="0"
        scrolling="no"
        allowTransparency="true"
        style="width: 100%; height: 480px;"></iframe>


### Contributing to our code

We are looking for skilled web developers to help us build the front page on
our [battleforthenet.com][1] site. You can see our code right in this Github
repo by switching to the _gh_pages_ branch, and you can see the work we need
done on our **[Battle for the Net Trello board][3]!**

If you're interested in volunteering, contact <jeff@rubbingalcoholic.com>
