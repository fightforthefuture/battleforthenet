I'm calling on you to reject new proposals written by cable industry lobbyists and, instead, work to restore the strong protections for net neutrality and broadband access afforded by the FCC's now-repealed 2015 Open Internet Order.\n\nWe expect nothing less than the net neutrality protections the FCC undemocratically repealed in 2017. Please work with your colleagues to pass legislation that genuinely protects the digital rights of your constituents.\n\nThank you.\n"
