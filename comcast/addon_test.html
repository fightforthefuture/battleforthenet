                      Dear Chairman Wheeler,

                      <p>
                      The proposed merger between Comcast and Time Warner Cable is a disaster and must not be approved. No single firm -- and especially one that ranks as the most-hated company in America -- should be handed this much power over the future of media and the Internet.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      The combined company would be an Internet and cable TV juggernaut with unmatched power to crush competition and hike prices for consumers. In fact, Comcast has admitted that prices will only go up.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Comcast is already the nation’s largest Internet provider. With this takeover, Comcast would control the wires reaching into nearly 6 out of every 10 American homes. Comcast has been caught before abusing its gatekeeper power and violating Net Neutrality. Such problems will only worsen if this once-unthinkable deal moves forward.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      There’s no question this takeover would harm the public interest the FCC is supposed to protect. You have said yourself that America has too little broadband competition. I urge you to block the proposed merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable.

        <h2>The Letter</h2>



        <p>
        Dear FCC,
        </p>
        <p>
        The proposed merger between Comcast and Time Warner Cable is a disaster and must not be approved. No single firm -- and especially one that regularly ranks as the most-hated company in America -- should be handed this much power over the future of media and the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
        Comcast's takeover would position it as the only cable provider for nearly two-thirds of the country. The combined company would be an Internet and cable TV juggernaut with unmatched power to crush competition and hike prices for consumers. In fact, Comcast has admitted that prices will only go up.
        </p>
        <p>
        Comcast is already the nation’s largest high-speed Internet provider. With this takeover, Comcast would own the wires reaching into nearly 6 out of every 10 American homes. Comcast has been caught before abusing its gatekeeper power and violating Net Neutrality. Such problems will only worsen if this once-unthinkable deal moves forward.
        </p>
        <p>
        There’s no question this takeover would harm the public interest the FCC is supposed to protect. I urge you to block the proposed merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable.  
        </p>

              <p>
              <strong>I cut the cord a long time ago and only subscribe to streaming services. How will this impact me?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
              Online video and innovation will suffer most.
              </p>
              <p>
              Comcast doesn’t want you getting your Scandal fix from Netflix or Amazon Prime so it’ll do everything it can to keep you as a subscriber even if you watch all your TV online. That’s what happens when your Internet company is also your cable company.
              </p>
              </br>
              <p>
              <strong>Comcast and Time Warner Cable don’t compete anyway, so how does this deal impact consumers?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
              This is all about competition and market power.
              </p>
              <p>
              The merger will bring us one giant company that controls marquee television and movie content, as well as the primary vehicles — a major television broadcast network, a major cable system operator and a major broadband Internet access provider — for distributing that content.
              </p>
              </br>
              <p>
              <strong>Doesn’t Comcast have to abide by the FCC’s old Net Neutrality rules?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
              Comcast’s commitment to Net Neutrality expires in 2018.
              </p>
              <p>
              Comcast has to obey the FCC’s Open Internet Order, but only as a condition of their previous merger with NBC. These protections come with a clear expiration date in 2018.
              </p>
              <p>
              And it’s important to remember that the only reason Comcast is under these conditions is because it was caught illegally blocking lawful file-sharing applications. This is the same company that degraded Netflix service for its own customers as a bargaining chip. And Comcast executives have been quite clear about their desire to divide the Internet into fast and slow lanes.
              </p>
              <p>
              Comcast has long exploited loopholes in FCC rules to favor its own services and harm competitors. And the FCC’s old Open Internet Order doesn’t apply to interconnection, the point at which Internet content companies hand off traffic to Comcast for deliver on its network.
              </p>
              <p>
              In the end, the company’s empty promises aren’t any consolation given how the merger will erode our online rights over the long term.
              </p>
              </br>
              <p>
              <strong>Would combining these companies be beneficial for customers?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
              Doubtful. Comcast and Time Warner Cable are both routinely at the very bottom of customer-satisfaction lists. They are ranked as the worst companies in America.
              </p>
              <p>
              If these companies can’t serve their existing communities well, how will expanding help? If anything Comcast will have even less incentive to provide good, reliable service because it knows its subscribers have nowhere else to turn.
              </p>
              <p>
              And Comcast already has too much control over content. Because a bigger, badder Comcast would control both content and distribution on a grander scale, it would have both the incentive and the power to limit access to competing content on the distribution platforms it owns. It could also try to outright deny its competitors access to its content.
              </p>
              </br>
              <p>
              <strong>I don’t subscribe to Comcast or Time Warner Cable... does this deal affect me?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
              This new giant company would have so much power over programming and such a chokehold on innovation that no new channels or services are going to get off the ground without permission from Comcast.
              </p>
              <p>
              And whether you’re a cable subscriber or not, you’ll end up paying more because the costs of doing business with Comcast will be passed on to you.
              </p>
              <p>
              But this deal isn’t just about dollars. It’s about democracy.
              </p>
              <p>
              Comcast already wields a great deal of power in Washington: The company spent more than $18 million on lobbying in 2013 alone. The merger would give Comcast an even better shot of ensuring that future communications policies favor its bottom line.

              <h2>Six Popular Myths Debunked</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Myth: Cord cutters have nothing to worry about.</strong>
                </br><span>Fact: Online video and innovation will suffer most.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
              Comcast doesn’t want you getting your Scandal fix from Hulu or Amazon Prime so it’ll do everything it can to keep you as a subscriber even if you watch all your TV online. That’s what happens when your Internet company is also your cable company.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Myth: Comcast and Time Warner Cable don’t compete anyway, so this deal doesn’t change anything.</strong>
                </br><span>Fact: This is all about competition and market power.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
              The merger will bring us one giant company that controls marquee television and movie content, as well as the primary vehicles — a major television broadcast network, a major cable system operator and a major broadband Internet access provider — for distributing that content.  And while cable companies have effective local monopolies over Internet and cable service, they do compete over where they have those monopolies.  If your city wants to dump its deal with Comcast or extract better terms from them, it’ll have fewer other options to turn to.
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Myth: The Comcast merger is a boon for Net Neutrality.</strong>
              </br><span>Fact: Comcast has to obey the FCC’s Open Internet Order but only until 2018 -- because they were caught violating Net Neutrality.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
              First of all, Comcast has long exploited loopholes in these rules to favor its own services and harm competitors. Second, these protections come with a clear expiration date. In the end, the company’s empty promises aren’t any consolation given how the merger will erode our online rights over the long term. The temporary order doesn’t even apply to interconnection -- the point at which Internet content companies hand of traffic to Comcast for delivery on its network.  So Comcast can demand fees from content providers for the right to access Comcast customers.
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Myth: Time Warner Cable will improve with Comcast’s help.</strong>
              </br><span>Fact: Comcast is routinely at the bottom of customer-satisfaction lists.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
              If Comcast can’t serve its existing communities well, how will expanding help? If anything Comcast will have even less incentive to provide good, reliable service.
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Myth: There are plenty of sources for content and information.</strong>
              </br><span>Fact: Comcast already has too much control over content.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
              Because a bigger and badder Comcast would control both content and distribution on a grander scale, it would have both the incentive and the power to limit access to competing content on the distribution platforms it owns. It could also try to outright deny its competitors access to its content.
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Myth: I don’t subscribe to Comcast or Time Warner Cable, so this deal has no impact on me.</strong>
              </br><span>Fact: This deal isn’t just about dollars. It’s about democracy.<span>

        <p>
          This is the time to go big, visible, and strong - that's the only way
          we can actually win this fight. We all need to get as many people in
          our respective audiences motivated to do something. We can make this
          epic, but only if you help. We need companies to be frontrunners,
          leaders, and heroes on this, that’s the key ingredient to raising the
          bar and making sure everyone goes big.
        </p>
        <p>
          We realize it's a big ask, but this is the kind of bad internet
          legislation that comes along (or gets this close to passing) once a
          decade or so.  If it passes we'll be kicking ourselves for
          decades&mdash;every time a favorite site gets relegated to the slow
          lane, and every time we have to rework or abandon a project because of
          the uncertain costs paid prioritization creates. Doing the most we can
          right now seems like the only rational step.
        </p>
