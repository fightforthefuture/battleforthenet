title: Maryland can still save net neutrality
body_html: |
  Telecom giants like AT&T and Comcast tried everything to water down the best state level net neutrality bill in the
  country, Marylandâ€™s SB 822, but they failed. The bill has been restored and is now headed for a vote on the Assembly
  floor. But the ISPs are still lobbying fiercely to defeat it. **Call the Maryland Assembly right now and tell them to
  pass SB 822 and restore net neutrality!**
