      {name} sold you out by voting against net neutrality bill SB 822.

Let {name} know that you’re outraged your elected official sided with big telecom companies over constituents. [Then contact the Governor.](/california/)

    {name} took {amount} in “campaign donations” from big ISPs.  No wonder this representative opposes strong net neutrality protections that would prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, Spectrum, and AT&T from throttling traffic, blocking access to apps, and imposing unfair fees. Contact your lawmaker now and let them know that your online freedom is more important than handouts to corporate monopolies.  Then share this page with everyone in your social network to turn up the pressure.
