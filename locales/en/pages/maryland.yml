title: Maryland can still save net neutrality
intro_html: |
  Victory! The Maryland Legislature just passed SB 822, the strongest net neutrality bill in the country. Now Governor Jerry Brown has 30 days to decide whether to sign it, and lobbyists for big telecoms like AT&T and Comcast will be pushing hard for a veto. Call the Governor right now and tell him to sign SB 822 and restore net neutrality!
