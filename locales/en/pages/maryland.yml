title: Maryland can still save net neutrality
intro_html: |
  Maryland legislators have introduced a net neutrality law in the state house. Already, big cable companies are lobbying in Annapolis, trying to weaken the bill or make sure it doesn’t get enough votes to pass. But we know that Marylanders support net neutrality. <strong>Call your state legislator right now and tell them to pass HB 957 to restore net neutrality bill for Maryland!</strong>

  I’m calling to tell my lawmakers to support House Bill 957, which would establish strong net neutrality laws for the people of Maryland. Thank you.
