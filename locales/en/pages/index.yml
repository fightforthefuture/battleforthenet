  The FCC killed net neutrality at the federal level, and now a US appeals court has
  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-internet/us-appeals-court-will-not-reconsider-net-neutrality-repeal-case-idUSL1N2A62BA" target="_blank">
  ruled</a> in favor of the FCC's disastrous decision. As the courts turn against us,
  our last remaining hope is to pass strong net neutrality laws at the state level
  while building up support in Congress for national legislation. **Contact your
  lawmakers now and urge them to save net neutrality.**

    We need net neutrality now more than ever.

    Since the FCC repealed net neutrality, Internet service providers (ISPs) have been routinely throttling Internet speeds ... something ISPs promised they wouldn't do. The truth is that we need strong, enforceable net neutrality laws to ensure that our online freedom is protected.

    Eighty percent of Americans support net neutrality, including Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. We urge you to do the same.  Please work with your colleagues to support the Save the Internet Act so that Americans can once again use the Internet without fear of throttling, censorship, or unfair fees.

    Thank you.

    title: State Fights for Net Neutrality
    body_html: |
      <p>Ever since the FCC repealed net neutrality we’ve <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kz4g9x/study-proves-the-fccs-core-justification-for-killing-net-neutrality-was-false" target="_blank">seen the impact</a>: Slower connections, bogus fees, and even threats to public safety—with none of the increased broadband investment promised by FCC chair Ajit Pai.</p>

      <p>But when the court ruled on the repeal, they threw out the part that blocks states from enacting their own net neutrality laws. This gives us a huge opening, so we’re taking the fight to the states!</p>

        throttling traffic</a> "pretty much everywhere all the time." Worse yet,
        federal courts have

        refused</a> to overturn the FCC's disastrous decision, leaving us with few
        options to restore freedom online.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our last hope? Win net neutrality at the state level. This will show the

        lawmakers to enshrine net neutrality into national law once and for all.

      Save the Internet Act of 2019
    body_html: |
      In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted the
      <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/04/13/2015-07841/protecting-and-promoting-the-open-internet"
         target="_blank">
        Open Internet Order</a>
      to protect Internet users from ISPs throttling traffic, censoring content,
      and imposing unfair fees. But just a few years later, a new chairman of the FCC
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-vote.html"
         target="_blank">
        killed net neutrality</a>
      by repealing the Open Internet order. It's clear that we can't count on unlected
      bureaucrats to consistently defend our online freedoms, and we can't rely on the
      courts to overrule disastrous policy decisions, either. We need strong legislation
      to protect net neutrality for as long as the Internet exists.

      We're making Congress listen
    body_html: |
      Voters from across the political spectrum agree: they don't want their
      cable company to control what they see and do online. The FCC's reckless
      repeal of net neutrality has sparked an unprecedented backlash, as
      millions of Americans have contacted their lawmakers in protest.  The
      numbers below represent actions taken through BattleForTheNet.com and its
      partners. Many more have taken action on other sites or contacted their
      lawmakers directly.

      To help convince the House, <a href="#bftn-action-form">contact congress

  net-neutrality:
    title: What is net neutrality? Why does it matter?
    body_html: |
      Net neutrality is the principle that everyone should have access to
      websites and apps, preventing Internet providers like Comcast & Verizon
      from creating “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/verizons-mobile-video-wont-count-against-data-caps-but-netflix-will/"
      target="_blank">fast lanes</a>,” <a

      content</a>,
      <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/186576-verizon-caught-throttling-netflix-traffic-even-after-its-pays-for-more-bandwidth"
      target="_blank">throttling traffic</a> and even outright <a
      href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/fcc-fines-verizon-125m-for-blocking-tethering-apps/2012/07/31/gJQAXjRLNX_blog.html"
      target="_blank">blocking access</a> to their competitor's products. This
      principle has guided the world wide web from the beginning, and has been
      protected by federal policy under Republican AND Democrat leadership since
      the <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf"
      target="_blank">early 2000s</a>.

      Unfortunately, Internet providers ignored this policy and even actively
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014)"
      target="_blank">sued the federal government</a> to destroy net neutrality
      protections … and they won. Their anti-consumer practices finally convinced
      the FCC to issue the Open Internet Order as a last resort in 2015. But
      under new leadership, the FCC has removed these regulations, threatening
      to end the web as we know it. A federal court ruling has opened up a path
      for net neutrality laws at the state and national level, giving open Internet
      supporters hope that the Save the Internet Act can enshrine net neutrality
      into law once and for all.
