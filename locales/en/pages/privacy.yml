    body_html: |
      Fight for the Future is committed to protecting your privacy. If you
      sign onto one of our various mailing lists, petitions, or use our
      contact tools, we retain the information you provided to primarily
      manage our mailing lists, and secondarily to transmit only the
      information that is required to service providers and public officials
      when required to submit your communications with them.

      We do not sell our email list. We do not share or distribute your
      contact information unless specifically stated so.

      If you sign up to volunteer or RSVP to a local event&mdash;for example
      by submitting your phone number in a volunteer signup field&mdash;we
      may share your contact information with partner organizations, third
      party services, or other volunteers, for the purposes of volunteer
      coordination only.

      For petitions, open letters, or similar public communications that
      you’ve signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and
      comments as public information. We will not make your street address
      publicly available, but we may transmit it to public officials as part
      of a petition or open letter, and they may make it public.

      If you enter your information as part of a clearly-labeled “joint
      action” with another organization, we may share your name, email and
      other information you have entered with the partner organization(s) for
      that particular action. If you are submitting your information to one of
      these campaigns or websites, you are opting into the sharing of your
      information for the stated purposes and will be treated as so.

      We sometimes carry out our business or operate our website using third
      party tools or services. Information may be shared with the operators of
      those tools or services in connection with our use of those tools or
      services to carry out business or operate our website.

      <a href="https://demandprogress.org/">Demand Progress/Demand Progress Action</a>
      takes your privacy very seriously. We do not share your email address or
      other personal information with unauthorized entities without your
      permission.

      We use the information we collect to inform you of news, activism
      opportunities, and other matters that relate to Demand Progress/Demand
      Progress Action, and to deliver petition signatures, emails/letters,
      and similar communications to designated targets.

      For petitions, emails/letters, or similar public communications that
      you’ve signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and
      comments as public information. We will not make your street or email
      address publicly available, but we may transmit such information to
      public officials/petition targets as part of a petition, open letter,
      or similar correspondence. (For instance, this information must be
      included to enable delivery of emails to members of Congress or comments
      to administrative agencies.)

      DP (501(c)3 arm) and DPA (our 501(c)4 arm) have a resource sharing
      agreement that enables each to contact activists whose contact
      information was gathered by the other. Our 501(c4) arm and our 527
      entity (also called Demand Progress) also have such a resource sharing
      agreement.

      DP/DPA owns and administers the Watchdog.net site. And as of the summer
      of 2013, DP/DPA owns and administers Rootstrikers.org. DP/DPA may
      contact subscribers to the Watchdog.net and Rootstrikers.org sublists.
      You may unsubscribe from email alerts from any or all of DP/DPA,
      Rootstrikers.org, or Watchdog.net at any time.

      If you enter your information as part of an action that is organized in
      partnership with one or more other organizations, and labeled as such,
      then we may share your name, email, and other information you have
      entered with the partner organization(s) for that particular action. We
      house data in accounts we hold with vendors such as ActionKit and Action
      Network. We sometimes enlist third-party vendors to help us manage data.
      We may use cookies from third parties such as Google Adwords to serve
      ads based on usage of this site.

      If you sign up to volunteer &mdash; for example by submitting your phone
      number in a volunteer signup field &mdash; we may share your contact
      information with partner organizations, third party services, or other
      volunteers, for the purposes of volunteer coordination.

      DP is a fiscally sponsored project of the New Venture Fund, and DPA is
      a fiscally sponsored project of the New Venture Fund.

      If you have any questions about our privacy policy, don’t hesitate to
      contact us.

    title: Free Press
    body_html: |
      <a href="http://freepress.net/">Free Press and the Free Press Action Fund</a>
      are committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website, as
      well as that of our members and activists. In fact, we support enhanced
      protections for everyone’s electronic and Internet privacy.

      In this policy, “Free Press” refers to both Free Press and Free Press
      Action Fund staff, board members, cooperating attorneys, interns,
      volunteers and consultants.

      In general, Free Press and our software partners treat your contact
      information as private and confidential. Free Press will not give, sell,
      rent, exchange or otherwise share your information with anyone else
      without your prior consent except as compelled by law (see below).

      We will notify users of updates to this policy by noting the date of new
      changes directly below this statement.

      This policy was last amended on July 10, 2017.

      Policy effective May 1, 2003.

      **Website Policies**

      Free Press and third-party vendor servers may record the IP address of
      your computer; the browser software you use and your operating system;
      the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the
      website from which you linked to our site.

      We use this information to measure the number of visitors to different
      sections of the site, to diagnose and correct system errors and to
      improve the site. We do not connect this information to your name or
      identity, and we do not retain this information permanently.

      Information that is not provided with the express intent of
      subscription, ordering, membership or donation will not be captured for
      use in other communications unless otherwise noted. We (and our vendors)
      restrict the use of “cookies” on this site primarily to convenience
      features such as auto login, surveys and polls. We typically delete
      these cookies as soon as is reasonably possible.

      **External Links**

      Free Press has not reviewed all of the sites linked to this site and is
      not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any off-site
      pages or any other sites linked to this site, whether or not they are
      affiliated with Free Press or the Free Press Action Fund. Such linked
      sites are for your convenience only and you access them at your own
      risk. Free Press makes no representations or warranties as to the
      accuracy or functioning of any such link. That another website is linked
      to our site does not constitute endorsement from Free Press or the Free
      Press Action Fund of the owner of the other site, the content of its
      site or its products or services.

      **Electronic Mailing List Policies**

      Free Press offers several electronic mailing lists. If you choose to
      subscribe to any of these lists, we may ask for personal information
      such as your name, ZIP code and email address. We use this information
      solely to manage our lists (for example, we may use your ZIP code for a
      targeted mailing on an issue affecting your area). We do not sell or
      rent our electronic mailing lists.

      If you sign up to volunteer—for example by submitting your phone number
      in a volunteer signup field on a website form —we may share your contact
      information with partner organizations, third party services, or other
      volunteers, for the purposes of volunteer coordination.

      There are a number of ways to subscribe to Free Press’ electronic
      mailing lists, including submitting a form on our website, opting in
      when you engage in online or offline activism, or mailing or completing
      a sign-up form from a paper petition, brochure or flier. When you
      subscribe, you will typically receive a confirmation message welcoming
      you.

      You may unsubscribe from any of our lists at any time. If you wish to
      update your information, delete or otherwise make changes to your
      relationship with us, or remove yourself entirely from our list(s),
      <a href="http://act2.freepress.net/unsubscribe/unsubscribe_freepress/">click here.</a>

      Lists Free Press maintains for electronic mailings are exclusively
      “opt-in” lists. We do not purchase information from third-party sources
      or gather personal data from the Web (known as spidering) for inclusion
      in our email lists.

      **Online Activism**

      Our website offers many ways to engage in online activism. Many of these
      tools are hosted and administered by a third party (currently ActionKit).
      When you provide personal information by signing a petition or engaging
      in other actions, that personal information may be stored on our
      server(s) and/or ActionKit’s server(s). If you choose to join a mailing
      list or become a member at the same time that you participate in an
      online action, your relevant information will be kept and used for those
      other purposes.

      We may deliver petitions and surveys you’ve completed to the president,
      federal and state legislators, agencies like the Federal Communications
      Commission, other elected and appointed officials, or other entities
      such as companies whose policies we seek to change. We ask for your
      address so we can deliver your message to the appropriate legislative
      offices, and may include information such as your name, town or city and
      state in these deliveries.

      ActionKit strictly adheres to policies preventing unauthorized access to
      your personal information and will not make such information available
      to anyone outside of Free Press or ActionKit (unless legally compelled
      to do so).

      **Financial Support**

      Free Press and the Free Press Action Fund are committed to maintaining
      the trust and security of all financial supporters. We collect personal
      information including the email and mailing addresses that members and
      donors provide. We might use this information for online and print
      mailings to keep you informed about our programs and occasionally to ask
      for additional financial support. You may opt out of these
      communications at any time.

      To opt out of email communication,
      <a href="http://act2.freepress.net/unsubscribe/unsubscribe_freepress/">click here.</a>

      To opt out of print mailings, please call us at 413-585-1533 or
      <a href="mailto:info@freepress.net">email us</a>.

      On occasion, Free Press or the Free Press Action Fund sends messages on
      behalf of other reputable organizations when we believe such messages
      may be of value to our members and supporters. Our ability to send you
      these messages on behalf of other entities helps us build our membership
      base and further the movement for your rights to connect and
      communicate. If you do not wish to receive such messages from our allied
      or aligned organizations, please call us at 413-585-1533 or
      <a href="mailto:info@freepress.net">email us</a>. Free Press is not
      responsible for the privacy practices or the content produced or
      provided by any of these other entities.

      All financial data is collected via a secure Web connection, and is
      stored or transmitted using appropriate security measures at all times.

      **Online and Phone Orders for Materials**

      Information provided to us in the course of placing an order for
      educational materials, activist toolkits, promotional materials or other
      materials offered by Free Press (whether or not the materials are
      offered at a cost) may be retained for use in future communications,
      such as membership drives, or when we unveil similar offerings we
      believe may be of interest to you. This information will not be given,
      sold, rented, shared or otherwise provided to anyone else without your
      prior consent (except when compelled by law — see below).

      All financial data is collected via a secure Web connection, and is
      stored or transmitted using appropriate security measures at all times.

      **Compelled Disclosure**

      If we are required by law to disclose any information that you have
      provided us, we will attempt to give you notice (unless we are
      prohibited from doing so) that a request for your information has been
      made, in order to give you an opportunity to object. We will attempt to
      provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or
      by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not
      challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn
      over your information. In addition, we may independently object to any
      disclosures we believe to be improper.

      **Questions?**

      If  you would like additional information about our privacy practices
      and/or our policies, please contact info(AT)freepress.net.
