title: New York can lead on net neutrality!
intro_html: |
  Governor Cuomo has announced his intention to pass the
  “<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kz4g9x/study-proves-the-fccs-core-justification-for-killing-net-neutrality-was-false" target="_blank">strongest net neutrality protections in the United States.</a>”
  But a lot of the legislation is being discussed behind closed doors,
  and that’s where Verizon, Comcast, and other ISPs can weasel their way
  in and weaken the bill. <strong>Call Governor Cuomo right now and tell him you’re
  holding him to his promise of the strongest net neutrality protections in the country!</strong>
call_script: |
  I expect Governor Cuomo to pass a strong net neutrality bill, and not to let the bill get weakened by the cable and telecommunications industry.

    Don’t let @NYGovCuomo pass a weak #NetNeutrality bill! Take action to make sure he doesn’t give into big cable, and that he actually passes the strongest bill in the country to protect our Internet! battleforthenet.com/newyork
